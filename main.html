<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, making it faster and more scalable.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of the input size. It is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to describe how memory usage grows with input.</p>
